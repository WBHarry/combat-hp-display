# Combat Hp Display
A Foundry VTT module for those that like to see Token HP bars while in combat but not otherwise.

Tokens that have been added to combat will automatically change the way they display HP and/or other bars on the token when combat is started. When combat is canceled their display status will also change depending on settings.
In the module settings you can set your preferred display type in and out of combat.

## Out Of Combat HP Display options
The display type that is set upon leaving combat
- Precombat Value - Tokens remember their previous display type and return to it (DEFAULT)
- Never Displayed
- When Controlled
- Hovered By Owner
- Hovered By Anyone
- Always For Owner
- Always For Everyone

## Combat HP Display options
The Display type that is set upon entering combat
- Never Displayed
- When Controlled
- Hovered By Owner
- Hovered By Anyone
- Always For Owner
- Always For Everyone (DEFAULT)

## Actor Displaybar Converter
A utility in the module settings for easily changing the Displaybar value on all actors. 

When I thought of displaying HP-bars using this module I already had a long-running campaign world. In my case all normal player tokens and monsters were set up to always show HP, and I altered them to Hovered By Anyone for more immersion and less green bars when out of combat.
